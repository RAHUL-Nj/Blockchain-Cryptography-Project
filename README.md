Description:
The "Blockchain Cryptography Project" is an educational web application aimed at providing users with an interactive and educational experience on blockchain technology and advanced cryptographic concepts. The project simulates a simplified blockchain network, allowing users to create transactions, mine blocks, and understand the critical role of cryptographic elements like hash functions and digital signatures in ensuring the security and integrity of the blockchain.

Features:

Blockchain Information:

Displays essential blockchain information, including the total number of blocks and transactions in the simulated blockchain.
Users can request and view this information by clicking the "Get Blockchain Info" button.
Create a Transaction:

Allows users to simulate creating transactions by specifying sender and receiver addresses along with the transaction amount.
Utilizes digital signatures to sign transactions, adding a layer of security and authenticity to the simulation.
Clicking the "Create Transaction" button displays the details of the created transaction, including the digital signature.
Mine Block:

Enables users to simulate the mining process by adding pending transactions to a new block on the blockchain.
Demonstrates how hash functions play a crucial role in creating the unique identifier (hash) for each block
